## What is UCL ISec?

The Information Security Research Group was set up in 2006, as a constituent part of the [University College London
](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/). Our research addresses key technical aspects of information security and privacy - such as cryptography and system security - and overall aims to deliver end-to-end security solutions, and address broader human, economic and societal aspects of security, privacy, and trust. We also support consultancy as well as develop and deliver advanced training in our areas of expertise. 

We maintain an active blog on topics related to our work. Find it [here](https://www.benthamsgaze.org/).
