Cryptocurrency trading at 10: From “Monopoly money” to billion-dollar derivatives markets  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYpf-2grTorGNxFnItdfR3SSG89tgyB9Zeh)] [[Live Stream]()]<details>**Abstract:** In a little more than a decade, modern cryptocurrencies have gone from a marginal product used mostly by hobbyists, to a viable alternative currency for fringe markets, to supporting an entire class of financial assets. In this talk, I will start by looking at the early days of spot markets (fiat for cryptocurrency), outlining some of the inherent risks in that ecosystem. I will then discuss how, since 2018, the cryptocurrency trading landscape has evolved to a hybrid ecosystem featuring complex and popular derivatives products. I will present results based on our study of BitMEX, one of the first derivatives platforms for leveraged cryptocurrency trading. BitMEX trades on average over 3 billion dollars worth of volume per day, and allows users to go long or short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage. I will discuss how BitMEX products have become the standard across other cryptocurrency derivatives platforms, such as Binance, FTX, or others, which now feature daily trading volumes that, in aggregate, rival those of the New York Stock Exchange. Through an analysis on-chain forensics, public liquidation events, and a site-wide chat room, I will describe the diverse ensemble of amateur and professional traders that forms this community, and how derivative trading has impacted cryptocurrency asset prices, notably how it has led to dramatic price movements in the underlying spot markets.<br><br>**Bio**: Nicolas Christin is an Associate Professor (with tenure) at Carnegie Mellon University, jointly appointed in the School of Computer Science and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, and was a post-doc at UC Berkeley prior to joining Carnegie Mellon in 2005.

FAQs
---

- *In what time zone are the seminars?*  
All seminars are on London time (typically at 16:00).
- *Can people not affiliated with UCL attend the seminars?*  
Yes, seminars are open to everyone! At the moment, we're virtual, so you just need to request the Zoom details or join the YouTube livestream. When we'll restart in-person, we'll post more details.
- *What's the difference between ACE and InfoSec Seminars?*  
ACE Seminars were part of our distinguished seminar series, organized with the support of, and funding from, the Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-centre-of-excellence/)).
InfoSec Seminars were informal-in-nature talks given by members of UCL's InfoSec group on very recent/work-in-progress research, but open to everyone nonetheless (unless explicitly noted). 
As all seminars are virtual at the moment, there is no difference.  
- *How do I subscribe to seminar announcements?*  
You can subscribe to our mailing list by sending an email with subject "subscribe" to infosec-seminars-join (at) ucl.ac.uk. You can also subscribe to our Google Calendar: \[[ICS](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/pk0m34jd9tiad42vk08vhlphbs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)\] \[[HTML](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=pk0m34jd9tiad42vk08vhlphbs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London)\].  
- *How can I learn more about InfoSec research and teaching activities at UCL?*  
Check out the UCL's InfoSec research group [page](/about). We also run an MSc in Information Security [Degree](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-taught/information-security-msc) and a [Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/) for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity, and maintain a [blog](https://benthamsgaze.org/) called Bentham's Gaze.

Transaction Fee Mechanism Design for the Ethereum Blockchain:<br>An Economic Analysis of EIP-1559  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYpf-2grTorGNxFnItdfR3SSG89tgyB9Zeh)] [[Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKsbLRSY41E)]<details>**Abstract:** EIP-1559 is a proposal to make several tightly coupled changes to the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction fee mechanism, including the introduction of variable-size blocks and a burned base fee that rises and falls with demand.  This proposal is slated for deployment in the London fork (scheduled for late summer 2021), and will be the biggest economic change made to a major blockchain to date.
In this talk we formalize the problem of designing a transaction fee mechanism, taking into account the many idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting (ranging from off-chain collusion between miners and users to the ease of money-burning). We then situate the specific mechanism proposed in EIP-1559 in this framework and rigorously interrogate its game-theoretic properties. We also touch on two alternative designs that offer different sets of incentive trade-offs.<br><br>**Bio**: Tim Roughgarden is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. Prior to joining Columbia, he spent 15 years on the computer science faculty at Stanford, following a PhD at Cornell and a postdoc at UC Berkeley.

Studying Jerks on the Web: A Socio-Technical Perspective  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdT80kD2K0)]<details>**Abstract:** Over the past two decades, the world has seen an explosion of data. While in the past controlled experiments, surveys, or compilation of high-level statistics allowed us to gain insights into the problems we explored, the Web has brought about a host of new challenges for researchers hoping to gain an understanding of modern socio-technical behavior. First, even discovering appropriate data sources is not a straight forward task. Next, although the Web enables us to collect highly detailed digital information, there are issues of availability and ephemerality: simply put, researchers have no control over what data a 3rd party platform collects and exposes, and more specifically, no control over how long that data will remain available. Third, the massive scale and multiple formats data are available in requires creative execution of analysis. Finally, modern socio-technical problems, while related to typical social problems, are fundamentally different, and in addition to posing a research challenge, can also cause disruption in researchers' personal lives. In this talk, I will discuss how our work has overcome the above challenges. Using concrete examples from our research, I will delve into some of the unique datasets and analyses we have performed, focusing on emerging issues like hate speech, coordinate harassment campaigns, and deplatforming as well as modeling the influence that Web communities have on the spread of disinformation, weaponized memes, etc. Finally, I will discuss how we can design proactive systems to anticipate and predict online abuse and, if time permits, how the "fringe" information ecosystem exposes researchers to attacks by the very actors they study.<br><br>**Bio**: Emiliano De Cristofaro is a Professor at UCL (UCL), where he heads the Information Security Research Group, a Faculty Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, and a co-founder of the iDramaLab. Before moving to London, he was a research scientist at Xerox PARC. He received a PhD in Networked Systems from the University of California, Irvine in 2011. Overall, Emiliano does research in the broad security, safety, and privacy areas. These days he mostly works on tackling problems at the intersection of machine learning and security/privacy/safety, as well as understanding and countering information weaponization via data-driven analysis. In 2013 and 2014, he co-chaired the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, in 2018, the security and privacy track at WWW and the privacy track at CCS, and in 2020 the Truth and Trust Online (TTO) Conference. He has also received best paper awards from NDSS, ACM IMC, and the Cybersafety workshop.<br><br>
