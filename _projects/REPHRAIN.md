REPHRAIN is the UK's National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online, exploring how
to keep people safe online while allowing them to fully participate in digital technologies and the contributions they
make to an innovative, inclusive and healthy economy and society. It was funded through an initial Â£8.6 million
three-year grant from UKRI. Topics covered in the centre's research include Computer Science, International Relations,
Law, Psychology, Management, Design, Digital Humanities, Public Policy, Political Science, Criminology and Sociology.
The centre was founded as a collaboration between the University of Bristol, UCL, the University of Bath, the University
of Edinburgh and Kings College London with further institutions joining through Strategic Funding Calls.
