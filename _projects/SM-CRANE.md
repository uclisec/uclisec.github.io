The CRANE network aims to:

- Support, develop and nurture research in cyber security within and across academic disciplines, with transformative challenge from wider stakeholder groups
- Identify and articulate emerging global trends and national strengths
- Support pilot projects that explore novel research which have the potential to develop into full-scale proposals
- Build an inclusive, sustainable research community that supports career development and fosters the exchange of ideas regionally and nationally on all aspects of cyber security
- Serve as a point of access to UK research for business, government and the third sector
