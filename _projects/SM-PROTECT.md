PROTECT is funded through the REPHRAIN Strategic Funding Call 3, supporting research on how to protect victims of
cryptocurrency fraud, a crime that disproportionately affects younger people. The work focuses on how an insurance-like
mechanism can help victims receive reimbursement for their financial losses. The solution preserves the decentralisation
properties of cryptocurrency payments, as well as protecting the independence of dispute adjudicators. Through a
combination of innovative cryptography, smart-contracts, and game-theoretic modelling the system facilitates the
development of a transparent and fair payment fraud insurance market.
