To achieve secure collaboration it is sometimes essential to not only to protect the content of communications, but also
protect the identity of participants from third party observers and possibly even between participants themselves.
Anonymous communication tools such as Tor can help achieve this goal, but only if they are sufficiently usable to allow
safe participation by non-experts. The collaboration scenario is also particularly challenging for anonymous
communication systems because the latency introduced by such systems can significantly harm usability. This project
explores the usability of collaboration tools in the context of anonymous communications, through a combination of
theoretical, qualitative and quantitative methods.
